# solar

A highly inaccurate 2d solar system simulation that demonstrates components, relationships, and filters.

### Getting started

Run `pnpm start` and visit http://localhost:5173. Zoom and pan using a mouse or touchpad.

Add `?teleport=true` (e.g. http://localhost:5173?teleport=true) to make the earth randomly orbit a new celestial body every few seconds. Open the console to see the `Changed` filter in action!
